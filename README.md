    + Folder TU DIEN VIET-BAHNAR_converted : Extract text from folder "Split Image"

# BINARIZATION IMAGE TO REMOVE NOISE TO IMPROVE QUALITY OCR
- Create an empty folder "Binary Image"
Run command:
```
python binary_image.py
```    
After run this file, We should have a folder with all image are converted into binary.
This helps remove noise from image and improve OCR quality.

# FINAL : USING OCR TESSERACT TOOL AND POST-PROCESSING
- Create two empty folder "Final" and "Final corrected"
+ Folder Final : Contains result OCR on folder Binary Image.
+ Folder "Final corrected": This folder contains the final result. The task is to find and replace all common mistakes.
+ Run command:
```
python ocr_binary_img.py
```
